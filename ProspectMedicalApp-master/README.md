Family Medicine ASP.NET Core MVC App

This is a project aimed at learning ASP.NET Core MVC. I used Entity framework Core for the database setup. I also made a challenge to myself by not
using bootstrap in order to get more comfortable with css as well as more front-end javascript and jquery practices.
